Initialization:

score is initialized to 0.
cross is initialized as true.
Two audio objects (audio and audiogo) are created, referring to audio files "Mpiano.mp3" and "mariofail.mp3" respectively.
An audio file ("Mpiano.mp3") is played after a delay of 1 second using setTimeout().
Event listener for keydown:

When a key is pressed, the document.onkeydown event is triggered.
The key code of the pressed key is logged to the console.
If the up arrow key (keyCode 38) is pressed, a CSS class (animateDino) is added to the dinosaur element to animate it.
If the right arrow key (keyCode 39) is pressed, the dinosaur's position (left style) is incremented by 112 pixels.
If the left arrow key (keyCode 37) is pressed, the dinosaur's position (left style) is decremented by 112 pixels.
Game loop (setInterval):

This loop runs repeatedly with a small delay (10 milliseconds).
It retrieves the positions of the dinosaur (dx, dy) and the obstacle (ox, oy).
The offsets (offsetX, offsetY) between the dinosaur and the obstacle are calculated.
If the offsets are below certain threshold values, the game is over:
The text of an HTML element with class gameOver is updated to display "Game Over - Reload to Play Again".
The obstacle's animation class is removed to freeze its movement.
The audio file "mariofail.mp3" is played using audiogo.
After a delay of 1 second, both audio files are paused.
If the offsets are within a range and cross is true, the score is increased:
The score is incremented by 1.
The updateScore() function is called to update the score displayed on the page.
cross is set to false to prevent further score increments.
After a delay of 1 second, cross is set back to true.
The animation duration of the obstacle is decreased by 0.1 seconds to increase the difficulty.
Function updateScore(score):

Updates the HTML content of an element (scoreCont) to display the current score.
Mouse movement effects:

The code is related to the mouse movement within a designated frame.
The circle element (#circle) and frame element (.frame) are selected.
The lerp function is defined, which performs linear interpolation between two values based on a given interpolation factor.
A mousemove event listener is added to the window, which updates the position of the circle element to the mouse position with a smooth animation using gsap.to() from the GSAP library.
Another mousemove event listener is added to the frame element, which calculates the interpolation factor (zeroone) based on the mouse's x-coordinate within the frame's dimensions.
The x-coordinate of the text element inside the frame is updated using gsap.to(), creating a parallax-like effect.
When the mouse leaves the frame (mouseleave event), the effects are reversed.
Overall, the code combines game logic (controlling the dinosaur, scoring, and collision detection) with mouse movement effects using the GSAP library.
